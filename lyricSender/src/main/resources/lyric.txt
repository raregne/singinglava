man:A long, long time ago there was a volcano
man:living all alone in the middle of the sea
man:He sat high above his bed watching all the couples play
man:And wishing that he had someone, too.
man:And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang
man:out loud everyday for years and years.
man:I have a dream I hope will come true
man:That you're here with me and I'm here with you
man:I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
man:will send me someone to lava.
man:Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone
man:until he was on the brink of extinction
man:But little did he know that living in the sea below
man:another volcano was listening to his song.
man:Everyday she heard his tune her lava grew and grew
man:because she believed his song was meant for her
man:Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
man:As he sang his song of hope for the last time.
man:Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano
man:Looking all around but she could not see him
man:He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone
man:But with no lava, his song was all gone
man:He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear
man:As she remembered what his song meant to her.
woman:I have a dream I hope will come true
woman:that you're here with me and I'm here with you.
woman:that the earth, sea and the sky up above-a
woman:will send me someone to lava.
man:Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea
man:All together now their lava grew and grew
man:No longer are they all alone, with aloha as their new home
man:And when you visit them this is what they sing.
man:woman:I have a dream I hope will come true
man:woman:That you'll grow old with me and I'll grow old with you
man:woman:We thank the earth, sea, the sky, we thank too.
man:woman:I lava you
man:woman:I lava you
man:woman:I lava you.
